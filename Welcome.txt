Wink! Wake up Wink! Our dungeon is being overrun with MONSTERS!
You must venture into the dungeon and collect all of the magical
keys in order otherwise they won't fit into your invetory properly!
Once you do that, Please kill these evil monsters for us. If you fail
our princess Zelba will surely be captured and killed by the monsters.

GOOD LUCK WINK!

          in a specific though unspecified order.
